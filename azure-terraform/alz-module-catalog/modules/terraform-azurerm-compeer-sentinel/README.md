# Compeer Sentinel

Onboards a Log Analytics workspace to Microsoft Sentinel when enabled and records the approved connector contract.

The connector contract is intentionally separated from onboarding because SOC ownership and licensing often require a staged rollout. Add concrete `azurerm_sentinel_data_connector_*` resources after connector ownership and cost are approved.

## Reusability and Extensibility

This module is designed as a reusable resource building block for Compeer platform and workload patterns:

- Resource-scoped ownership: the module models the Azure resource boundary, not a single application, environment, or landing-zone root.
- Pattern-ready interface: enterprise decisions such as naming, network placement, diagnostics, RBAC, private endpoints, and policy posture stay in the consuming pattern or root.
- Optional capability surface: optional Azure features are exposed through typed inputs, objects, maps, and empty defaults so consumers can enable them without forking the module.
- Stable identity for repeatable configuration: repeatable nested configuration uses keyed maps where identity matters, reducing unrelated replacement when an item is added or removed.
- Lifecycle-aware defaults: inputs favor provider-supported in-place updates and avoid generated names, positional indexes, or hidden defaults that create unnecessary replacement.
- Composition-ready outputs: IDs, names, endpoint details, and other downstream attributes are exported so dependent modules and HCP workspaces do not need to reconstruct implementation details.
- Backward-compatible growth: new capabilities should be added with optional inputs and sensible defaults; breaking input or output changes should be versioned deliberately.
- Validation focus: consumers should test create, no-change plan, in-place updates, optional feature add/remove, expected replacement cases, and destroy behavior before broad reuse.

Module-specific extension points: Sentinel onboarding is controlled by an enable flag and approved connector target state is represented as a contract for later SOC automation.
